# Eniac-Discounts
### Python/Tableau-GroupProject from DataScience-Bootcamp

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded in Spain and it has grown and expanded to other neighboring countries. Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth.

The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that your work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

- The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
- The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.


To find the answer, if discounts are benefitial or not, Data-Exploration and Data-Cleaning using Python and Data-Visulation using Tableau was done in this project.
